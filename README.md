# library development starter with CodeSandbox and Vite

This is a template for developing a JavaScript/Typescript library. It supports using both CodeSandbox and [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite) as development envirenment.

## develop in browser, with CodeSandbox

This project can be opened with [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/csr632/codesandbox-workspace/tree/master/workspace?moduleview=1&file=/demos/demo2/index$.tsx).

The advantage of CodeSandbox approach is that, **you can open and edit the project in browser**, and **you can easily share the link with others**.

> You can use the "current module view" option of CodeSandbox, to play with every demo.

## develop locally, with Vite

If you want to develop locally, run `npm run dev` to start local dev server. This envirenment is powered by vite and [vite-plugin-react-pages](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-pages).

The advantage of vite approach is that, you can get full power of vscode and git (and other local tools). It also has faster hmr and refresh time.
